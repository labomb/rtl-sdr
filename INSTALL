To build using cmake
=================================================================================

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ -DHAVE_BIAST=ON -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON -DINSTALL_DVBT_BLACKLIST=ON
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

The defines are optional and have the following meaning:

  HAVE_BIAST

  This will enable bias tee support for RTL-SDR.com V3 dongles. Each of the
  tools will have a new '-B' option to enable the bias-t supply. An additional
  rtl_biast tool will also be built, and provides a means to turn the dongle's
  bias-t supply on or off.

  INSTALL_UDEV_RULES

  This option will install udev rules that will enable recognition of various
  RTL-SDR dongles when plugged in to a USB port.

  INSTALL_DVBT_BLACKLIST

  This will install a file that will prevent your system from loading default
  DVB-T drivers that would interfere with the librtlsdr driver.

  DETACH_KERNEL_DRIVER

  This option will enable the ability to detach the kernel driver.
  

To build using autoreconf and configure 
=================================================================================

$ autoreconf -ivf
$ ./configure --enable-bias-t --enable-driver-detach
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

and optionally:

$ sudo make install-udev-rules
$ sudo make install-dvbt-blacklist
$ sudo ldconfig

The configure switches are optional, and have the following meaning:

  enable-bias-t

  This will enable bias tee support for RTL-SDR.com V3 dongles. It will also
  build the additional tool rtl_biast, which provides a means to turn the
  dongle's bias-t supply on or off.

  enable-driver-detach

  This option will enable the ability to detach the kernel driver.
